##Vector Library: FAISS

Vector libraries are often sufficient for small, static data sets. They do not provide full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) support, so once an index is built, any modifications to the vectors necessitate rebuilding the index from scratch. Despite this limitation, vector libraries are valued for their ease of use, lightweight nature, and speed. Examples include FAISS, ScaNN, ANNOY, and HNSM.

##FAISS: An Overview


FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a library designed for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. It supports various similarity search methods, including L2 (Euclidean distance) and cosine similarity. FAISS is particularly effective for large-scale data sets and provides several methods for optimizing and customizing the search process.
